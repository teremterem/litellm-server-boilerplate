</p>

**A lightweight LiteLLM server boilerplate** pre-configured with `uv` and `Docker` for hosting your own **OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible endpoints.** Perfect with **LibreChat** as the web UI (a quick setup of which is included in this repository) or any other OpenAI / Anthropic API compatible client. Contains an example of a custom provider that stylizes responses (Yoda example) to serve as a starting point for your own custom providers (which you can think of as **your own AI agents and assistants**).

> **⚠️ ATTENTION ⚠️** This `README` is intended for the [litellm-server-boilerplate](https://github.com/teremterem/litellm-server-boilerplate) repository.

## Architecture 📝

LiteLLM Server (Port 4000)

Your custom agents
```

## Quick Start ⚡

### Prerequisites

- [OpenAI API key 🔑](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) (or any other provider's API key that you're planning to use under the hood)
- Either [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (or both)

### GPT-5 caveat

If you are going to use GPT-5 via API for the first time, **OpenAI may require you to verify your identity via Persona.** You may encounter an OpenAI error asking you to “verify your organization.” To resolve this, you can go through the verification process here:
- [OpenAI developer platform - Organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general)

### Setup 🛠️

1. **Clone this repository, but use a special remote name (`boilerplate` instead of `origin`):**

   The reason `git clone` below uses `boilerplate` as the remote name instead of the usual `origin` is because this will enable you to set up `origin` to point to YOUR OWN remote repository in the later steps of this guide.

   ```bash
   git clone \
       --origin boilerplate \
       https://github.com/teremterem/litellm-server-boilerplate.git \
       my-litellm-server
   ```

   ```bash
   cd my-litellm-server
   ```

   > **NOTE:** You can replace `my-litellm-server` with a different name in both commands above.

2. **Rename `main` branch to `main-boilerplate` in your local repository:**

   This will later allow you to use the local `main-boilerplate` branch to occasionally pull in bugfixes, new features, etc. from the original `litellm-server-boilerplate` repo **(see the `"Staying up to date with the Boilerplate"` section later in this `README`)**, while making room for YOUR OWN `main` branch, which you will modify as you please and push to YOUR OWN remote (see further steps).

   ```bash
   git branch --move main main-boilerplate
   ```

3. **Create YOUR OWN `main` branch in your local repository:**

   Double-check that you're on the `main-boilerplate` branch (just in case).

   ```bash
   git switch main-boilerplate
   git pull
   git status
   ```

   Then create your own `main` branch (which will be based on `main-boilerplate`).

   ```bash
   git switch --create main
   ```

4. **(Optional) Set up `origin` remote and push your `main` branch to YOUR OWN remote repository:**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-remote-repository-url>
   ```

   > **ATTENTION:** Make sure your remote repo DOES NOT have a `main` branch of its own already. If it does, **EITHER** delete the remote `main` branch manually via a web interface, an app, etc. **OR** add `--force` flag to the `git push` command below to completely overwrite the remote `main` branch with all its history.
   >
   > **⚠️ Choose the latter ONLY IF YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS of using the `--force` flag when working with Git CLI AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING ⚠️**

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```

   Even though this step is optional, it is generally a good idea to have your own remote repository to push your changes to.

5. **Configure Environment Variables for the LiteLLM Server:**

   Copy the template file to create your `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key (and/or any other providers' API keys that you're planning to use):

   ```dotenv
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
   # GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

   ... # API keys (and other env vars) of any other providers

   # Optional (see .env.template for explanation):
   # LITELLM_MASTER_KEY=strong-key-that-you-generated

   ... # Other optional settings (see .env.template)
   ```

   See [Supported Models & Providers](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) document by LiteLLM for the full list of supported models and providers.

6. **Configure Environment Variables for LibreChat:**

   Copy `librechat/.env.example` to `librechat/.env`:

   ```bash
   cp librechat/.env.example librechat/.env
   ```

   (Optional) Edit `librechat/.env` if necessary (in case of local runs, it will work even if you don't edit it).

7. **Run your LiteLLM Server with LibreChat and the Yoda example** (make sure to install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) first):

   ```bash
   ./librechat/run-docker-compose.sh
   ```

   **OR**

   ```bash
   cd librechat
   ```

   Then

   ```bash
   docker compose -p litellm-librechat up
   ```

   Which, by default, will use both - `librechat/docker-compose.yml` and `librechat/docker-compose.override.yml`

   > **NOTE:** For consistent behavior it is better to switch to the `librechat/` subdirectory before running the `docker compose` command above (even if you specified the aforementioned compose yaml files via the `-f` flags explicitly), hence the `cd` command right before it.

8. **Lastly,**

- Navigate to **http://localhost:3080** in your web browser to open the LibreChat login page.
- Use the **`Sign up`** link under the login form to create an account.
- Log in with your new credentials.

**That's it!** You should now see a chat interface with **`Yoda`** as a working assistant example, just like in the screenshot at the beginning. 🎯

### Running your LiteLLM Server WITHOUT LibreChat

If you don't want to use LibreChat, you can run your LiteLLM Server directly.

> **NOTE:** This time you are expected to be in the `root directory` of the repository, **NOT** in the `librechat/` subdirectory.

- **OPTION 1:** Use a script for `uv` (make sure to install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first):

   ```bash
   ./uv-run.sh
   ```

- **OPTION 2:** Run via a direct `uv` command:

   ```bash
   uv run litellm --config config.yaml
   ```

- **OPTION 3:** Run via `Docker Compose` (make sure to install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) first):

   ```bash
   docker-compose \
      -f docker-compose.yml \
      -f docker-compose.dev.yml \
      up
   ```

## Development

When you run with Docker Compose, your local repository is bind-mounted into the containers (this whole repo - into the `litellm` container, and `librechat/librechat.yaml` - into the `api` container), so code changes are reflected without the need to rebuild the containers. Usually a simple compose restart is enough to pick up updates; use --build only if you change the base image or dependencies (`Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, `.python-version`). The bind mounts are defined in `docker-compose.dev.yml` (LiteLLM-only mode) and `librechat/docker-compose.override.yml` (complete LibreChat stack with your `librechat.yaml` custom configuration).

In order to set up your own custom provider and model(s), you will need to:

- Implement the provider class and required methods in a new module (similar to `yoda_example/`)
- Register your new provider in the `custom_provider_map` section of `config.yaml` under your chosen provider key.
- Declare your new model(s) in the `model_list` section of `config.yaml` under your chosen model key

> **NOTE:** Here, by **"models"** we really mean **agents**, because, to whatever clients connect to your LiteLLM Server (LibreChat or otherwise), they will only look like models. Behind the scenes, in your provider class you will likely have code that orchestrates the execution of one or more LLMs and possibly other tools.

See [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/) for more details. Especially, check out `Search for anything` in the top right corner of the documentation website - their AI Assistant (`Ask AI` feature in the `Search` dialog) is quite good.

### Keep LibreChat in sync with LiteLLM

- Mirror the changes to the LiteLLM Server configuration you made in `config.yaml` in `librechat/librechat.yaml`: add entries under `endpoints.custom` for connection details and extend `modelSpecs.list` to surface the model with a human-friendly label.
- If you want LibreChat to show multiple providers, adjust or remove the existing `modelSpecs` block; the shipped configuration intentionally limits the UI to the `yoda` model.
- After editing configuration, restart the compose stack (`./librechat/run-docker-compose.sh` or `docker compose -p litellm-librechat restart api litellm`) so LibreChat reloads the updated YAML.

See [LibreChat documentation](https://www.librechat.ai/docs) for more details.

> **NOTE:** For more information on the `librechat/` folder in this repository specifically, see [librechat/README.md](librechat/README.md).

## Publishing your Docker images to a Container Registry

Publishing your images to a container registry might make deployment of your LiteLLM Server and LibreChat to your infrastructure (CI/CD, Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, etc.) more straightforward. Below we use GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) as an example; other registries (ECR/GCR/ACR/Docker Hub) follow the same pattern with different login/registry URLs.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub user/org you will publish under
- A GitHub [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `write:packages` scope
- Docker installed on your machine
- Multi-arch `buildx` enabled in Docker (see [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/install-buildx/))

### 1) Log in to GHCR

```bash
# Replace <GITHUB_USERNAME> and ensure $GITHUB_PAT is set in your shell
echo "${GITHUB_PAT}" | docker login ghcr.io -u <GITHUB_USERNAME> --password-stdin
```

> **WARNING:** Never commit your PAT to version control. Store it in a secure secret manager or CI secret.

### 2) Publish your LiteLLM Server image

The root Dockerfile builds the LiteLLM server (listens on port 4000 by default).

Multi-arch build and push (recommended):

```bash
IMAGE="ghcr.io/<OWNER>/<image-name>"
VERSION="0.1.0"

docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}" \
  -t "${IMAGE}:latest" \
  --push .
```

Single-arch (dev) alternative:

```bash
IMAGE="ghcr.io/<OWNER>/<image-name>"
VERSION="0.1.0"

docker build -t "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}" -t "${IMAGE}:latest" .
docker push "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
docker push "${IMAGE}:latest"
```

### 3) Publish a LibreChat image with your custom `librechat.yaml`

The Dockerfile at `librechat/Dockerfile` extends the official LibreChat image and bakes in your own version of `librechat.yaml`, which removes the burden of later supplying your custom `librechat.yaml` file into your deployment container "from the outside".

Choose coordinates and build:

```bash
LIBRECHAT_IMAGE="ghcr.io/<OWNER>/librechat-with-config"
VERSION="0.1.0"

docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t "${LIBRECHAT_IMAGE}:${VERSION}" \
  -t "${LIBRECHAT_IMAGE}:latest" \
  --push \
  librechat/
```

### Notes and tips

- Replace `ghcr.io/<OWNER>/...` with your own registry path. For other registries, adjust the login and tag (e.g., `123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/your-image`).
- Prefer semantic versions (e.g., 0.1.0) and keep `latest` for convenience.
- Make images public or grant access in GHCR settings so your deployment environment can pull them.

### If you want to test your published images locally

**Complete LibreChat stack (published images)**

- Image switching (see comments in `librechat/docker-compose.override.yml` for details):
  - `services.litellm.image`: set to your published LiteLLM image
  - `services.api.image`: set to the LibreChat image you want
- Start the stack:
  ```bash
  cd librechat
  docker compose -p litellm-librechat up
  ```
- Access LibreChat UI: http://localhost:3080

**Standalone LiteLLM Server (published image)**

- Image reference: follow the comments in `docker-compose.yml` to point `services.my-litellm-server.image` to your published image.
- Start:
  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```
- Verify:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:4000/health
  ```

## Staying up to date with the Boilerplate

Once you start customizing your copy, you might want to occasionally bring in the newest Boilerplate improvements. The steps below assume you cloned the original Boilerplate using `boilerplate` as the remote **(see the `"Setup"` section in the beginning)** and that YOUR OWN repository is connected as `origin`.

1. **Make sure your working tree is clean.**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   Commit or stash anything pending before you proceed.

2. **Fetch the latest boilerplate branch.**

   ```bash
   git fetch boilerplate main:main-boilerplate
   ```

3. **Switch to your local `main` branch.**

   ```bash
   git switch main
   ```

4. **Merge the upstream updates into your branch.**

   ```bash
   git merge boilerplate/main
   ```

   If Git reports conflicts, resolve the files Git marks, `git add` them, and run `git commit` to complete the merge before continuing.

5. **Push the refreshed branch to your own repository.**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

That’s it - your `main` branch now contains the latest Boilerplate changes while keeping your customizations in place.
