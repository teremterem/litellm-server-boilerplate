OPENAI_API_KEY=

# OPTIONAL: Set the Anthropic API key if you still want to use Anthropic models
# (which you can do by unsetting some of the remaps below in this file, or by
# explicitly setting them to map back to the Anthropic models).
#ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# OPTIONAL: Authentication for the proxy (recommended when exposing the proxy
# beyond your machine). Set a strong random key to require clients to
# authenticate to the LiteLLM proxy.
#
# When set, clients must present this key as their API key when calling the
# proxy. For Claude Code CLI, you can pass it inline like so:
# ```
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<LITELLM_MASTER_KEY>" \
#   ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000 \
#   claude
# ````
# (If you've previously signed in with Claude Code, run `claude /logout`.)
#LITELLM_MASTER_KEY=

# RECOMMENDED: You are better off relying on the remaps below, rather than
# setting the desired model in Claude Caude CLI via `claude --model gpt-5-...`
# (even though you could also do that).
#
# The reason being that there are some built-in agents in Claude Code that do
# not inherit the model that was chosen globaly for the CLI and instead are
# hardwired to always use specific models by Anthropic.
#
# (If you do not want to use these remaps but also want to avoid getting
# warnings, then, instead of commenting them out, simply set them to empty
# strings.)
REMAP_CLAUDE_HAIKU_TO=gpt-5-nano-reason-minimal

# OPTIONAL: Override base URLs if needed
#OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
#ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com

# RECOMMENDED: Keep the setting below `true` (or unset, which is equivalent).
# Claude Code CLI cannot handle multiple tool calls in a single model response,
# which GPT-5 with medium/high reasoning effort may attempt.
#ENFORCE_ONE_TOOL_CALL_PER_RESPONSE=true

# OPTIONAL: Langfuse configuration for logging all LiteLLM requests/responses.
# Useful for debugging.
#
# NOTE: If you set these keys, make sure to install Langfuse with either
# `uv sync --all-extras` or `uv sync --extra langfuse`
